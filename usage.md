  dark="/images/new_assessment_dark.png"
  alt="New Assessment"
/>

1. Navigate to **Customer Detail** -> **Assessments** -> **New Assessment**

     > ⚠️ Note: Selecting CVSS version 2.0 allows you to view vulnerabilities associated with this version. However, adding new vulnerabilities using CVSS v2.0 is not supported. This option is useful for managing legacy vulnerabilities imported from Nessus that only include CVSS v2.0 scores.
   - **Environment**: Production | Pre-Production | Testing (Optional)
   - **Testing Type**: Black box | Grey box | White box (Optional)

## Vulnerability Management

### Adding Vulnerabilities Manually

<ThemeImage
  light="/images/new_vulnerability.png"
  dark="/images/new_vulnerability_dark.png"
  alt="New Vulnerability"
/>

1. Navigate to **Assessment** -> **Vulnerabilities** -> **New Vulnerability**

2. Select a **Category** (e.g., "SQL Injection", "XSS")
   - Generic description auto-populated from categories
   - Ticking the "Show categories from all sources" checkbox will include categories created during automatic scans (e.g. Nessus, Burp) among the selectable categories
   - Ticking the "Generic remediation" checkbox will add the remediation included in the category; leaving this box unticked will prevent it from being included

3. Fill in details:
   - **Detailed Title**: Specific vulnerability name (Optional)
   - **Status**: Open | Fixed | Partially Fixed
   - **Target**: Affected target

4. **CVSS Scoring**:
   - Select CVSS version (based on assessment config)
   - Use the calculator or enter vector string
   - Score auto-calculated

5. **Description & Remediation**:
   - Write details to specifically describe the identified vulnerability
   - If necessary, include a more specific remediation

6. **References**:
   - Add URLs, CVE IDs, etc. (One per line)

### CVSS Calculator

The built-in CVSS calculator supports:

- **CVSS v3.1**: Base, Temporal, Environmental
- **CVSS v4**: Base, Supplemental, Environmental, Threat metrics

**Usage:**

1. Select CVSS version
2. Choose values for each metric
3. Vector string and score auto-generate
4. Severity level displayed (None, Low, Medium, High, Critical)

### Adding Proof of Concept (PoC)

<ThemeImage
  light="/images/edit_poc.png"
  dark="/images/edit_poc_dark.png"
